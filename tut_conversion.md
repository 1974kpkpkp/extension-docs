I think the flow should be as follows

1. you have an extension

2. click upgrade button

3. check out what's inside the zip

4. try it out in developer mode (on opera:extensions)

5. package the zip using opera:extension button

the pack button that is

6. upgrade (<- this is important) your extension

and submit to moderation

and then you'll see 2 extension streams: one with OEX and one with CRX/NEX

so you can maintain them separately

that's it
