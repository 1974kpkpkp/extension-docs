## Introduction

Extensions are small code packages that you can add to your browser to extend its functionality. The point of Opera extensions is to not only add more features to Opera, to make it more useful, but also to share those new features with other Opera users. Want to add an e-mail notification window to the browser that brings up your latest mails form your preferred mail service? Want to add a button that closes all tabs to right of the active tab? Want to tweet straight from the browser, replace all instances of the word "politics" on web pages with "fish", or bring up translations of the current selection in a tooltip? Extensions are the way forward. You can develop extensions to do pretty much anything that can be done with standards web technologies, and more.

The Opera Extensions API allows you to tap into many different features of the browser, giving you a lot options for extension functionality. This article will get you started, looking at what's available, providing links to further information.

Note: If you haven’t already, then head over to the [Opera Extensions Gallery](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/) to download and get a feel of various extensions.

## Already developed Chrome Extensions?
If you have already developed extensions for Chrome then you will feel right at home making extensions for Opera 14 and above. Opera is now based on the Chromium project, which means it is possible to run CRX files in Opera 14 and above. For a list of which *chrome.\** APIs we support, please read the [technical overview](tut_architecture_overview.html) of extensions in Opera.

## Porting your previously made Opera extensions
Because Opera 14 is using the Chromium extensions model, existing Opera extensions need to be converted to CRX or NEX format to work in new and future Opera versions. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. If you have already submitted Opera extensions to the Opera extensions gallery, you will find an option on your extension pages to convert them into a suitable format for Opera 14+. 

We've also made a tool, which will convert your *.oex* based extensions into the new extensions format. [Read more about the tool](tut_conversion.html). 

## Learn the basics
To learn how to make Opera extensions, begin by reading our [making your first Opera extension](tut_basics.html) article: this will get you familiar with the basics of making a simple extension.

Next, we would suggest taking a look at the [technical overview of Opera extensions](tut_architecture_overview.html), to get a more complete overview how things work.

With the basics behind you, consult our [range of tutorials and walkthroughs](http://sample.com/index.html) for much more detailed information on specific aspects of extension development and API usage. 

## Test, debug and look things over
Identify issues and solve them easily by reading our [guide to testing and debugging Opera extensions](tut_testing.html). 

## Finally, show it to the world!
You can share your extensions with the world by submitting them to the Opera add-ons gallery. To make this process easier and smoother, read the [guidelines on submitting extensions](tut_publishing_guidelines.html) to the add-ons store. We’ve also provided a [handy checklist for you to follow](http://sample.com/index.html), to speed up the submission process further. 

## Updating your extension?
If you already have an existing extension in the store and want to update it, follow these [steps on releasing updates to Opera extensions](tut_publishing_new_version.html); your users will receive the latest and greatest version of your extension in no time!
