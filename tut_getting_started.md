# Getting Started with Opera Extensions
*By Shwetank Dixit*

Extensions are small pieces of functionality you can add on top of the browser. The point of extensions is to allow you to add great features and enhancements to Opera, which other Opera fans might also find usefull.  Examples include an extension which could close all tabs to the right hand side of the current tab, or an extension which notifies you of new mail from your favourite email service etc. If you haven’t already, then head over to the [Opera Extensions Gallery](Link to the gallery) to download and get a feel of various extensions.

The Opera Extensions API provides you with a number of features of the browser you can tap into, thereby giving you a lot options for you to come up with great ideas for extensions.  

## Already developed Chrome Extensions?
If you have already developed extensions for Chrome, then you will feel right at home making extensions for Opera 14 and above. Opera is now based on the Chromium project, which means it is possible to run CRX files in Opera 14 and above. For now, we support the following APIs for CRX format. We have additional APIs for extensions, which will be available under the '*opr*' object, and will be required to have a ‘*.NEX*’ file extension. 

## Porting your previously made Opera extensions
With Opera 14, we have changed the extensions platform. This means previously made Opera extensions will need to be converted to the new format for it to work in Opera 14 and above - But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. If you had subbmitted your old Opera extensions to the Opera extensions gallery, they you will have the option to have it converted into a format suitable for Opera 14 and above. 

We've also made a tool call '*OEX2CRX*' (**--Is this going to be the name of the too, or will be change it?--**) which will convert your *.oex* based extensions into the new extensions format. Feel free to also read the [article we have written](Link to the oex2crx tool article) about the tool.
