 <p>This is our new documentation section for extensions in Opera 14.</p>
 <p>As Opera has switched <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/300-million-users-and-move-to-webkit">from Presto to Chromium</a>, our extensions infrastructure has also gotten a major overhaul: Opera's own OEX format is no longer supported, and in <a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/next">Opera 14</a>, we've switched to Chromium's extension model. At this point, we support a subset of the Chromium extension APIs — with more to come —, as well as our own Speed Dial API.</p>
 <p>To get you started, we've prepared a number of tutorials and have included relevant API documentation as well.</p>
