 <p>This is our new documentation section explaining how to build extensions for the all new <a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/next">Chromium-based Opera browser</a> for computers.</p>
 <p>With Opera switching <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/300-million-users-and-move-to-webkit">from Presto to Chromium</a> and a complete UI remake, our extensions infrastructure has also gotten a major overhaul: from <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/next/">Opera 15</a> onward, <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operaextensions.js/tree/master/docs">Opera 11 &amp; 12’s extension format</a> is no longer supported, and instead, <strong>we’ve switched to Chromium’s extension model</strong>. At this point, Opera 15 supports a subset of the Chromium extension APIs — with more to come —, as well as our own Speed Dial API.</p>
 <p>If you have created a Chromium extension before, be sure to try it out in the all new Opera, and if it works fine, upload it to our <a href="https://addons.opera.com/developer/upload/">extensions catalog</a>!</p>
 <p>If you're new to Chromium extension development, we’ve prepared a number of tutorials and have included relevant API documentation as well. We’ve also built a conversion tool to make the transition from the old to the new format as smooth as possible: in the <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/developer/">extensions catalog's developer panel</a>, click the green "Convert" button and follow the steps.</p>
