 <p>This is our new documentation section for extensions in Opera 14.</p>
 <p>As Opera has switched <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/300-million-users-and-move-to-webkit">from Presto to Chromium</a>, our extensions infrastructure has also gotten a major overhaul: in Opera 14, Opera 11 &amp; 12’s extension format is no longer supported, and instead, we've switched to Chromium’s extension model. At this point, Opera 14 supports a subset of the Chromium extension APIs — with more to come —, as well as our own Speed Dial API.</p>
 <p>To get you started, we’ve prepared a number of tutorials and have included relevant API documentation as well. We’ve also created <a href="tut_oex2nex.html">a conversion tool</a> to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p>
